# DiveBuddy

Marketplace for dive trips (short and long), organized by dive centers or by local divers. Single monorepo for app + backend.

## Product context

Core problems being solved (independent, not sequential):
1. **Local coordination** — ad-hoc trips (e.g. evening dives with a dive center) need a way to split transport costs / offer rides among participants.
2. **Local search when traveling** — dive centers abroad run rigid schedules; a self-organized trip with local divers is often the only way to dive off-schedule.
3. **Discovery friction** — checking every dive center's site/schedule individually is slow; trips from dive centers and individuals should be searchable in one place, filterable by location and time.

MVP scope (deliberately small — logbook and dive-center self-service publishing are later phases, not v1):
- List of open trips
- Trip detail + join flow
- Trip chat (transport coordination lives here, not a separate feature)
- Diver profile with self-reported certifications (no verification API yet — planned for later)

Go-to-market: start by running trips personally (partnering with dive center **KingFish** for promotion) rather than waiting for a two-sided marketplace to bootstrap itself. Once there's an active user base, invite KingFish (then other dive centers) to publish their own trips directly.

## Stack

| Layer | Tech |
|---|---|
| App (mobile + web) | Flutter — single codebase, mobile-first design, builds to iOS/Android/Web |
| Admin (future, for dive centers) | Flutter, same codebase family |
| Backend | Go, PostgreSQL |
| Chat | Managed/off-the-shelf WebSocket library — do not build chat infra from scratch |
| Deploy | DigitalOcean |

## Repo structure

```
DiveBuddy/
  app/        # Flutter app — iOS, Android, Web (not yet scaffolded)
  admin/      # Flutter admin panel for dive centers (future phase)
  backend/    # Go API — GET /health, POST/GET /trips (Postgres-backed)
```

## Build & Development

### Backend (`backend/`)

```bash
make dev              # go run . — hot-reload not included, restart manually
make dev-build        # compile to ./bin/app
make dev-run          # build + run in background, logs to ./bin/app.log
make dev-stop         # stop background process
make dev-logs         # tail ./bin/app.log
```

Local server runs on `http://localhost:8080` by default (`PORT` env var overrides). Requires `DATABASE_URL` (see `.env.example` → copy to `.env`).

#### Docker Compose (Postgres + migrations)

```bash
make compose-up       # starts postgres, applies migrations automatically
make compose-down
make compose-logs
```

Postgres is exposed on `127.0.0.1:5433` for local `make dev`/`make dev-run`.

#### Database Migrations

Requires `golang-migrate` CLI (`brew install golang-migrate`). `DATABASE_URL` must be set in `.env`.

```bash
make migrate-up       # apply all pending migrations
make migrate-down     # roll back one migration
```

Migrations live in `backend/migrations/`. In compose mode, the `migrate` service runs automatically before you'd run the API.

### Packages (`backend/internal/`)

| Package | Responsibility |
|---|---|
| `server` | HTTP router, route registration, handlers |
| `config` | Env-var loading (`.env` via godotenv) |
| `db` | Database connection pool (pgx) |
| `trip` | Trip domain: model, repository, service |

### App (`app/`)

Not yet scaffolded. Will run independently via `flutter run` from `app/` — no dependency on the backend Makefile above.

## Architecture

The Flutter app follows the **flutter-mvvm-architecture** skill (`.claude/skills/flutter-mvvm-architecture/`): MVVM in the UI layer (Views + ChangeNotifier ViewModels), Repository pattern in the data layer (Services → Mappers → Repositories → domain entities), with an optional Use Case layer for logic that doesn't belong in a ViewModel. Follow it when scaffolding new features.

## Git workflow

- Final branch: **develop**
- Push `develop` to remote directly, then open a PR manually via the GitHub UI. Do not merge locally into any branch beyond `develop`.
- Feature work branches off `develop`.
